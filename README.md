### **Classification - Max Life Health Insurance Cross Sell Prediction**
**Project Overview**

In the highly competitive landscape of insurance, cross-selling additional products to existing customers is essential for maximizing revenue and enhancing customer loyalty. This project focuses on predicting customer interest in purchasing a vehicle insurance policy, specifically targeting customers who currently hold a health insurance policy. By accurately identifying potential customers for this cross-sell opportunity, the model aims to improve marketing efforts, reduce acquisition costs, and elevate customer satisfaction.

**Objective**

The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that assesses the likelihood of a customer expressing interest in a vehicle insurance policy. Using various customer data points—including demographics, vehicle information, insurance history, and interaction channels—the model aims to deliver reliable predictions for cross-sell opportunities. The main target variable, Response, reflects whether a customer would consider the cross-sell offer.

**Key Challenges**

**Data Imbalance:** The dataset may contain significantly fewer interested customers than uninterested ones, creating potential bias in model predictions.
**Feature Engineering:** Effective feature engineering will be essential to boost model accuracy.
**Scalability:** The model should handle large datasets efficiently, scaling as needed.
**Model Evaluation:** Precision-focused metrics are crucial to accurately measure the model’s success in identifying true positives while minimizing false positives.
## **Deliverables**

* A trained machine learning model predicting the likelihood of positive customer responses to cross-sell offers.
* A detailed report including:
* Data preprocessing techniques
* Feature engineering insights
* Model selection and optimization strategies
* Performance evaluation using precision and recall metrics
  
**Model Performance**

The final model achieved the following metrics:

**Accuracy: 94.89%**

**Recall: 99.83%**

**Precision: 90.87%**

**F1-Score: 95.14%**

These results underscore the model's ability to reliably predict customer interest in vehicle insurance, supporting its application in a real-world marketing context.
